The number of people residing in a given state that were born in another one yields the migration flows between the two of them. In turn, we compute the revealed comparative advantage of the migration destinies, that is, if each of the states is receiving from another particular state more than its fair share of immigrants. The size of the arrow indicates the value of the revealed comparative advantage. There is a regional pattern: states usually receive more than their fair share of migrants from nearby states.",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Close to three decades since the end of Apartheid, South Africa still displays some of the worst labor indicators in the world, with the highest unemployment rate and one of the lowest employment rates amongst both emerging and advanced economies. The country’s unparalleled unemployment rate conceals the fact that the country’s labor market is highly segmented, and is composed of insiders and outsiders. South Africa's labor markets are both segmented by education level, as high skill workers face significantly smaller levels of unemployment, but also spatially, as formal private activity is the lowest in the former homelands territory.",

The country’s debt buildup in the last decade is largely explained by planned fiscal policy: expected primary balance contributions and automatic debt dynamics. A quarter of the increase can be attributed to forecast errors in unexpected primary balances as well as unexpected growth misses. Finally, a significant share is explained by below-the-line SOE recapitalizations and bailouts.",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Global vaccination for COVID-19 has proven to be extraordinarily inequitable. Most developed countries now have high vaccination levels whereas least developed countries tend to have very low vaccine access and, as a result, remain very vulnerable to health and economic impacts of new waves and variants of COVID-19. Debt levels have grown for most nations as a result of COVID-19, but debt increasingly constrains fiscal space of developing countries while the pandemic continues to demand greater spending to support resilience and recovery. It is surprising to see how small the total debt of ~70 low-vaccination countries is in comparison to total GDP of ~80 high-vaccination countries. Since total debt of low-vaccination countries amounts to less than 3% of total GDP of high-vaccination countries, it is possible that a relatively small financial expense by wealthy countries to pay down the debt of vulnerable poor countries could support a more equitable global recovery.",

This chart aims to attribute deviations of CPI from predicted values to policy, FX, supply and multiplier shocks in a way that is consistent with a theoretical model informed by Ethiopia’s unique economic structure. This chart indicates that shocks to the availability of FX have had a meaningful impact on inflation, but that key drivers of inflation and inflation volatility have shifted over recent years.",

This is in contrast with longer term (364-day) bills, which have seen total bids remain below the total amount offered, possibly due to investors’ perceived uncertainty.",

New work shows that the PCIs can be viewed collectively as a special pattern of transformation, with movement from low-PCI products to high-PCI products capturing the mode of transformation that takes an economy the longest span of time to execute.  This comes with a new way of viewing the Economic Complexity Index shown in the right panel: The ECI is a coordinate that conveys how far an economy has moved along this special axis of change",

Jordan tends to export its most complex products to nearby markets and its least complex exports to more distant markets. Jordan exports a large volume of higher complexity products to Saudi Arabia and a very large volume of lower complexity products to the United States, with trade to other markets in the EU, China, and India falling somewhere in between. As regional conflicts and low oil prices reduced export potential to the Middle East over the last decade, Jordan’s overall exports have grown to the U.S. market, but these have been primarily focused in low-wage and low-complexity garment products.",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, job losses were most concentrated among young Jordanians — a group where unemployment was already high prior to the pandemic. Given very low female employment in Jordan, this job loss was actually larger as a proportion of jobs for young Jordanian women (>20% of youth female jobs) than young Jordanian men (<15% of youth male jobs). Job losses were also felt among older working age males, but jobs grew for older working age women. The reasons for this pattern are not entirely clear but the pattern may indicate more resilient growth in labor market opportunities for women with higher levels of education alongside intensifying challenges affecting Jordanian youth.",

In contrast, young Namibians at all educational levels have a higher chance of being unemployed, but it does not vary as much beyond those with a primary education. Therefore, while educational attainment matters for being employed, it matters even more so in conjunction with experience.",

    "TITLE": "Jordan’s public sector appears large because its private sector is small",
    "DESCRIPTION": "Public sector* employment in Jordan represents 20 percent of total employment. This share is high, above the world median. Yet, Jordan’s employment to population ratio is below regional peers and the world median, at around 33 percent. As such, given total employment levels, the public sector in Jordan  serves as a critical employer in the economy.\n*Note: For the purpose of this figure, public sector is defined as the Civil Service at the Central Government level, government units and local governments.",

    "TITLE": "Public sector wage premia in Jordan by education and over time",
    "DESCRIPTION": "Public servants in developing countries tend to earn a positive premium compared to similar workers in the private sector. In Jordan, we leverage labor force surveys in years 2008 and 2018 to compare public servants to their observational equivalents in the private sector. We use mincer wage equations to observe the average premium associated with public employment, for Jordanians at specific levels of schooling, holding age, occupations, gender, location constant. We find that, in 2008, public servants without a college degree are associated with a large positive premium compared to identical private sector employees, holding observable traits constant. The observed premium increased between 2008 and 2018 for those with secondary or postsecondary (aka diploma) schooling. On the other hand, in 2008, public servants with bachelor or master degrees were, on average, associated with a negative premium compared to private sector employees at a similar level of schooling, holding age, gender, occupation and location constant. This result turned positive by 2018.",

    "TITLE": "COVID-19’s Disparate Impacts on Long-Term Growth",
    "DESCRIPTION": "These graphs capture the disparate nature of the COVID-19 shock on different economies. IMF projections from prior to the pandemic (Oct. 2019) are shown by the dashed red line and most recent projections (Oct. 2021) by the dashed blue line. In the United States, COVID-19 caused a contraction in 2020 but a strong recovery is underway. By 2022, the size of the economy is projected to be larger than what was expected prior to COVID-19. In Europe, the 2020 contraction was sharper and the recovery is slower, but projections nearly converge to the pre-pandemic path. China has seen a small overall disruption from its growth path. But the situation is very different for many developing countries. India, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa are on track for a severe long-term reduction in growth that diverges from their pre-pandemic paths. These projections should be a call to action to fight the pandemic’s impact on global inequality.",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Which industries use similar occupations? Which industries have a higher proportion of \"teleworkable\" jobs? This visualization answers these two questions. First, we show how industries-nodes - proportional to employment in the U.S. and colored according to broad economic sectors - are alike in terms of occupations.  They are linked if they use similar workers. Industry colors indicate their teleworkable propensity: the darker the color, the higher the share of teleworkable occupations in those industries. Interestingly, the cluster of professional, scientific, and technical services mostly coincides with the set of highly teleworkable activities. We use this analysis to study whether countries such as Colombia, could create a vibrant cluster exporting services to developed countries.",
