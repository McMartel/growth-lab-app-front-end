The number of people residing in a given state that were born in another one yields the migration flows between the two of them. In turn, we compute the revealed comparative advantage of the migration destinies, that is, if each of the states is receiving from another particular state more than its fair share of immigrants. The size of the arrow indicates the value of the revealed comparative advantage. There is a regional pattern: states usually receive more than their fair share of migrants from nearby states.",

Farm products are close to one another in this space if they require similar capabilities, including climate, soil, water, and infrastructure conditions, as well as related knowhow of farmers. Colors on this visualization reflect natural clustering. The Ethiopia project team is exploring use of this network to understand diversification opportunities within agriculture for various areas of the country, particularly areas where household livelihoods are at risk due to climate change and other pressures.",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Global vaccination for COVID-19 has proven to be extraordinarily inequitable. Most developed countries now have high vaccination levels whereas least developed countries tend to have very low vaccine access and, as a result, remain very vulnerable to health and economic impacts of new waves and variants of COVID-19. Debt levels have grown for most nations as a result of COVID-19, but debt increasingly constrains fiscal space of developing countries while the pandemic continues to demand greater spending to support resilience and recovery. It is surprising to see how small the total debt of ~70 low-vaccination countries is in comparison to total GDP of ~80 high-vaccination countries. Since total debt of low-vaccination countries amounts to less than 3% of total GDP of high-vaccination countries, it is possible that a relatively small financial expense by wealthy countries to pay down the debt of vulnerable poor countries could support a more equitable global recovery.",

In line with this effort, the team built a vector autoregression model, which uses sign restrictions derived from the theoretical model as an identification strategy, to conduct a historical decomposition of inflation. This chart aims to attribute deviations of CPI from predicted values to policy, FX, supply and multiplier shocks in a way that is consistent with a theoretical model informed by Ethiopia’s unique economic structure. This chart indicates that shocks to the availability of FX have had a meaningful impact on inflation, but that key drivers of inflation and inflation volatility have shifted over recent years.",

This chart shows that while Ethiopia has been succeeding in mobilizing more savings (as a share of deposits) through treasury bills auctioned at market-determined rates, there has been an over-concentration in 91-day and 182-day bills in recent months, indicating a possible liquidity crunch for these maturities. This is in contrast with longer term (364-day) bills, which have seen total bids remain below the total amount offered, possibly due to investors’ perceived uncertainty.",

New work shows that the PCIs can be viewed collectively as a special pattern of transformation, with movement from low-PCI products to high-PCI products capturing the mode of transformation that takes an economy the longest span of time to execute.  This comes with a new way of viewing the Economic Complexity Index shown in the right panel: The ECI is a coordinate that conveys how far an economy has moved along this special axis of change",

The composition of what Jordan exports to different trading partners varies significantly. Jordan tends to export its most complex products to nearby markets and its least complex exports to more distant markets. Jordan exports a large volume of higher complexity products to Saudi Arabia and a very large volume of lower complexity products to the United States, with trade to other markets in the EU, China, and India falling somewhere in between. As regional conflicts and low oil prices reduced export potential to the Middle East over the last decade, Jordan’s overall exports have grown to the U.S. market, but these have been primarily focused in low-wage and low-complexity garment products.",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, job losses were most concentrated among young Jordanians — a group where unemployment was already high prior to the pandemic. Given very low female employment in Jordan, this job loss was actually larger as a proportion of jobs for young Jordanian women (>20% of youth female jobs) than young Jordanian men (<15% of youth male jobs). Job losses were also felt among older working age males, but jobs grew for older working age women. The reasons for this pattern are not entirely clear but the pattern may indicate more resilient growth in labor market opportunities for women with higher levels of education alongside intensifying challenges affecting Jordanian youth.",

    "TITLE": "The Role of Experience in Unemployment in Namibia",
    "DESCRIPTION": "In assessing the relationship between unemployment and educational attainment, data from Namibia shows that experience matters a lot - both by itself and in conjunction with educational attainment. Individuals who have between 20-40 years of experience (proxied by the age group of 40-60 years) are less likely to be unemployed at every level of educational attainment, and the drop is steepest for those who have tertiary education. In contrast, young Namibians at all educational levels have a higher chance of being unemployed, but it does not vary as much beyond those with a primary education. Therefore, while educational attainment matters for being employed, it matters even more so in conjunction with experience.",

    "DESCRIPTION": "This figure maps Kazakhstan's product space opportunities against its regional, global, and OECD peers. Opportunities to diversify are relatively far away from Kazakhstan's current export basket. We compare Kazakhstan to three sets of peers - those in the geographic neighborhood, global peers similar in terms of export basket composition, and OECD peers. The further left the distribution is, the lower the feasibility of new products are. Compared to its peers, Kazakhstan is at a tough starting point to diversify into new products, and most of its new product opportunities demand capabilities that are relatively far away from its current capability set.",

    "DESCRIPTION": "This figure charts the relationship between GDP and educational attainment for all countries, highlighting Kazakhstan and other former-Soviet peers. For all levels, these countries stand out. Post-Soviet-era policies stressed the importance of educational access, among access to other public goods, and there was a significant policy focus to educate young people and promote higher learning as well. This graph charts data for all countries in the world and highlights former Soviet Union countries in yellow and Kazakhstan in red. At every level, from primary to tertiary education, these countries perform well relative to their real GDP per capita, most notably in primary educational attainment.",

    "DESCRIPTION": "In this graph is a sector-wise breakdown of Kazakhstan's exports. It does not export many products; they are concentrated in metals; within sectors, its exports have lower PCI than global averages. This graph plots the PCI of every product within a sector and sizes the bubbles by the share of global export that the product represents. Moreover, each sector has two lines that indicate the average PCI of the exports of that sector by Kazakhstan and by the whole world. In general, Kazakhstan’s exports have a lower average PCI in each sector than the world average. The shade of blue further represents the RCA of the products that Kazakhstan exports - most of them are concentrated in the metals sector, with a low average PCI. The country also does not seem to export many products that contribute significantly to global trade.",

    "DESCRIPTION": "Public servants in developing countries tend to earn a positive premium compared to similar workers in the private sector. In Jordan, we leverage labor force surveys in years 2008 and 2018 to compare public servants to their observational equivalents in the private sector. We use mincer wage equations to observe the average premium associated with public employment, for Jordanians at specific levels of schooling, holding age, occupations, gender, location constant. We find that, in 2008, public servants without a college degree are associated with a large positive premium compared to identical private sector employees, holding observable traits constant. The observed premium increased between 2008 and 2018 for those with secondary or postsecondary (aka diploma) schooling. On the other hand, in 2008, public servants with bachelor or master degrees were, on average, associated with a negative premium compared to private sector employees at a similar level of schooling, holding age, gender, occupation and location constant. This result turned positive by 2018.",
